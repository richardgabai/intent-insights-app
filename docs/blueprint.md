# **App Name**: Intent Insights

## Core Features:

- User Input: Accept user input for product and category of interest.
- Query Refinement: Use a tool to formulate and refine search queries from a category and product description, optimizing for information which suggests imminent purchase. This includes keyword searches, competitor searches, company visitation, duration and depth of site visits, new hiring for product decision makers, demo requests, pricing requests, and other relevant indicators specific to a B2B environment, leveraging Chrome's access to global search data. Payment orchestration is used as an example, but any product or service is valid.
- SERP Scraping: Scrape search engine results pages (SERPs) based on refined queries.
- Intent Summarization: Extract and summarize information from scraped content related to user's intent to purchase using generative AI, including product names and reasons for the purchase intent.
- Data Presentation: Display summarized intent data, sorted by relevance and confidence.
